Fun quiz app with trivia questions. 


This project was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`vitejs`](https://vitejs.dev/) with TypeScript.

I have also included an e2e test using [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidubanyi/quiz-app.git

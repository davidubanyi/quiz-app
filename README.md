This is David Ubanyi's submission for the g2i react developer coding challenge. 


This project was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`vitejs`](https://vitejs.dev/) with TypeScript.

I have also included an e2e test using [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)




## Get Started - Serving the dev

First,  clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidubanyi/g2i_t.git

cd g2i_t

npm i
```


Second, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
